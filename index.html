          Hi! I'm Saswath. I'm a trained software engineer who completed his bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from 
          SRM Institute of Science and Technology (SRMIST), Kattankulathur, Tamil Nadu. Soon after graduation, I joined Oracle's
          MySQL Development Team, specifically in its cloud division to work on MySQL as a service (MySQLaaS), Oracle Cloud's fully
          managed database service. I've remained here from 2021 till now, gaining valuable knowledge in the areas of software and API
          testing, testing automation with Java and JUnit and working with Python and cURL to create scripts to automate certain areas
          of manual testing. I've also had hands-on experience with Jenkins while executing and monitoring various post-deployment 
          Jenkins jobs and often used Grafana for monitoring a large number of concurrent runs.
